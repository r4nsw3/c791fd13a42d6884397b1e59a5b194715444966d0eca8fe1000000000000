  |   Psikyo is coming back!                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Vorg heard a rumor that the army of Satan was searching for           |
  |   treasures called Seirei stones which led him to think that the time   |
  |   for revenge has come. In addition, he also knows that one of the      |
  |   Seirei stones was entrusted secretly to King Silverna from Vorg's     |
  |   homeland, the Kingdom of Miltia.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Vorg, who was a holy knight in Miltia, was in the forest town of      |
  |   Neraphai working for a mission when the king of Satan, Ifter,         |
  |   invaded the Kingdom of Miltia with Dhatilos armies.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Upon hearing the news, Vorg immediately returned to Miltia, but the   |
  |   kingdom has been destroyed.                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   After 7 years, a dark shadow went into the royal room inside the      |
  |   Silverna castle. That dark shadow was Satan, Ifter.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Vorg heads to Silverna castle with his Helos. Satan owns the Sol      |
  |   Divide which is the pair of heilos.                                   |
